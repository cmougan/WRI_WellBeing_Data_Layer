## Project Scope
Conducting economic surveys requires huge resources; thus, modern means of acquiring this information using publicly available data and open source technologies create the possibilities of replacing current processes.
Satellite images can act as a proxy for existing data collection techniques such as surveys and census to predict the economic well-being of a region.

The aim of the project is to propose an alternative to Demographic Health Surveys using opoen source data such us Open Street Map, Sentinel and Night Light data.

The initial prototype created a model that had an accuracy of almost 70 percent. 
The aim is to create a model for India that can be adapted and scaled to other countries.

## The Data

### Demographic Health Surveys
#### Introduction
Demographic Health Surveys collect information on population, health, and nutrition for each state and union territory. They are jointly funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and United Nations. All datasets are easily available at their website.

#### Omdena's Dataset
The team analyzed a dataset already cleaned by the Omdena Team. Although the dataset was skewed towards the poorest wealth class, the unbalance lied within 1 standard deviation, warranting the dataset workable.

### Open Street Maps Data
#### Introduction
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an opensource project that crowdsources the world map and has made it available totally free of cost. The data quality is generally seen as reliable although it varies across the world. 

#### Data set
Datasets were downloaded via the OSM api. For Minimum Viable Product purpose, data was downloaded only for the Maharashtra state of India. The dataset contained important information like coordinates and counts of geographical landmarks like highways, hospitals and educational institutes.
