## Project Scope

Conducting economic surveys requires huge resources; thus, modern means of acquiring this information using publicly available data and open source technologies create the possibilities of replacing current processes.
Satellite images can act as a proxy for existing data collection techniques such as surveys and census to predict the economic well-being of a region.

The project aims to propose an alternative to Demographic Health Surveys using open-source data such as Open Street Map, Sentinel, and Night Light data.

## The Data

### Demographic Health Surveys

Demographic Health Surveys collect information on population, health, and nutrition for each state and union territory.
They are jointly funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), and the United Nations. The datasets used in this project were obtained from the [dhsprogram](https://dhsprogram.com/) website.

The dataset was explored manually as well as through [Pandas Profiling library](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling). 
![Slight But Workable Skew](images/wealth_labels_pie.png)

Box and Violin plots were used to make the following observations:

- Wealth index had almost a perfectly linear normal distribution.
- Population density was found to have a positive correlation with the wealth index.
- Wealth and electricity usage are correlated (figure 1).
- The distribution of roof materials is highly diffused (figure 2). 
- Richer families prefer flush-toilets (figure 3).
- The distribution of water source is highly diffused (figure 4). 

![Figure 1: Richer Families Are Electrified](images/electricity.png)

![Figure 2: Choice of Roof Material is highly diffused](images/material_of_roof.png)

![Figure 3: Richer Families Use Flush-Toilets](images/richer_flush.png)

![Figure 4: Water Sources Are Highly Diffused](images/water_source.png)

The figures above visualize the different wealth distributions on several categorical features found on the dataset.

All the images are available in images folder and in the [(DSSG/WRI) DHS Analysis.ipynb](./(DSSG_WRI)_DHS_Analysis.ipynb) notebook


### Open Street Maps Data

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open-source project that crowds sources the world map and has made it available free of cost.
The data quality is generally seen as reliable although it varies across the world.

A python module [osm_data_extraction](./dssg/dataio/osm_data_extraction.py) was implemented to extract OSM data given the [GADM, Level 3](https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html) shapefile and a district name. The module uses [OSMNx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) which interacts with the OpenStreetMap's API to get the relevant data for a specific region and stores it in a csv file. An example usage of this module can be found in the notebook [araria_district.ipynb](./dssg/data-exploration/araria_district.ipynb).


Due to computing resource constraints, the area of study was restricted to the Araria district of Bihar state.



### Night-Time Light Data

Nighttime light data can highlight areas of greater economic activity as these regions tend to be relatively more lit.
Image data to proceed with this approach was obtained via Google Earth Engine (GEE).
GEE provides a quickly accessible collection of data images captured across timelines, 
lightwave lengths, and satellite systems.

The data is open and free to use for non-commercial use cases.
The first approach of this project explored the usefulness of the GEE interface and the monthly NTL images (from the mines dataset <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>

The second approach looked at another data stream (NASA Black Marble <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> to look at the daily variability of the data. 
Both approaches were useful to gain an understanding of the different flavors of NTL data, and how these data sources could be utilized in future projects.

A python module [ntl_data_extraction](./dssg/data/ntl_data_extraction.py) and a command-line app [download-nightlights](./dssg/apps/download-nightlights.py) were implemented to download the night light data for a given district and the date range.
The implementation uses the [modapsclient](https://pypi.org/project/modapsclient/), a RESTful client for NASA's MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS). The python module also implements a method to convert the hdf5 files to GeoTiff files for further processing. After conversion, from hdr (native format) to GeoTIFF, the daily NTL intensity tiles are available for processing. The project area (Continental India) is covered by 7 (or 8) tiles of 10x10 degrees, or 2400x2400 cells. To match the temporal window of the project (2013-2017, 2 years around the DHS 2015 census for India) the total NTL data
the repository would be more than 1825 data layers (4MB per HDR / 10MB per GeoTiff images).
The difference in disk size between HDR and GeoTIFF is the compression and data type, HDR files are optimized for storage, and will contain besides the light intensity values also the data quality
flags. The team used NASAâ€™s VIIRS/NPP LunarBRDF-Adjusted Nighttime Lights data with a spatial resolution of 500m.

The data was explored but due to a pressing need for computational resources and time, the data was not integrated with the other data sources and hence not utilized for solution building. We also concluded that for future computations it would be better to use annual composites of the night light data sets from the mines data repository [3], to reduce the need for large amounts of computational resources.

The implementation of the `osm_data_extraction` and `ntl_data_extraction` modules would be crucial to scaling the data processing pipeline for the rest of India or any other country in the world.

## Project Methodology

### Data Preparation

Socio-economic indicators are important measures to assess spatial or societal dimensions.
Although DHS data collected by governmental and non-governmental organizations are reliable and comprehensive choices to describe societal phenomena they are available only at certain years intervals for India.
In this project, a machine learning-based approach is used to predict the wealth index from OSM data based on DHS data as the ground truth.

[**Voronoi Tessellations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) appeared in the classic treatise of Snow on the 1854 cholera epidemic in London in which he demonstrated that proximity to a particular well was strongly correlated to deaths due to the disease.
It continues to be a very useful tool to study demographics, territorial systems, and accurate estimates of average rainfall in a region among other applications. 
In our case, we use a generalization of Voronoi Diagrams called **Laguerre-Voronoi Tessellations**,  famously known as [Power Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_diagram) to tessellate the DHS dataset [IAGE71FL.zip](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/India_Standard-DHS_2015.cfm). 
Laguerre Voronoi diagrams partition the Euclidean plane into polygonal cells defined from a set of circles.  
The motivation behind using this specific generalization comes from the peculiarity of the DHS data. 
DHS surveys contain confidential information that could potentially be used to identify an individual through unique information. 
To avoid this in all DHS surveys the center GPS coordinate of the populated place in a cluster is recorded and separate degradation error values, a random error of 5 km maximum in rural areas and 2 km maximum in urban areas is applied. 
All the details of the implementation of this tessellation on the DHS data can be found in the following places:

* [GitHub Gist : 2d Laguerre-Voronoi diagrams](https://gist.github.com/sunayana/a3a564058e97752f726ca65d56fab529)
* [gis-laguerre : Applications of Laguerre-Voronoi to GIS problems](https://github.com/dai-mo/gis-laguerre)
* [Data Preparation for Geospatial Analysis & ML with Laguerre-Voronoi in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-preparation-for-geospatial-analysis-ml-with-laguerre-voronoi-in-python-71b9b418d8b6)

![image.png](./images/weighted_voronoi_india_clipped.png)

**Combine DHS and OSM Data**: In the next step we combine the weighted Voronoi GeoDataFrame specific to a district with the OSM vector data of the same district using the following strategy:

* Every Voronoi cell has a unique DHS cluster id.
* Any point in the OSM vector data gets the DHS cluster-id depending on the Voronoi cell it belongs to.
* Any polygon from the OSM vector data gets the cluster id of the Voronoi cell it is contained in.
* Any polyline from the OSM vector data is split into several line segments belonging to different Voronoi cells and these line segments get the DHS cluster-id depending on the Voronoi cell they belong to.

  This pipeline was partially implemented in the [araria_voronoi.ipynb](./dssg/araria_voronoi.ipynb) notebook.

**Combine DHS and NTL Data**: Similar to the techniques used to match the OSM data to DHS clusters, a method will have to develop to aggregate the NTL to the appropriate DHS cluster. It would be recommended to use the same weighted Vonoroi polygons when doing the "Zonal Statistics"; a spatial operation designed to retrieve key statistics by area (polygons) from raster images.

### Evaluation Strategy

We tend to judge a model's generalization error by the gap between its performance in training and test <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
For this matter, it's important to strategically partition a dataset in a way that resembles what happens in the desired production environment.
Due to the few samples in the dataset restrictions, we performed a Leave One Out evaluation (LOOCV).
Leave-one-out cross-validation, or LOOCV, is a configuration of k-fold cross-validation where k is set to the number of examples in the dataset.

![Leave One Out Cross Validation](images/LOOCV.gif)

LOOCV is a computationally expensive procedure to perform,
although it results in a reliable and unbiased estimate of model performance.

### Label Transformation.

The original wealth index provided by the DHS data was a classification between 1-5 of the wealth level of a certain district.
`{1: Poorest  2: Poorer 3: Middle 4: Richer 5: Richest}`
This label even if at first might seem a multiclassification is a continuous feature that has been post-processed and binarized into categories.

We treat this problem as a regression task that then needs to be binarized again in the post-processing part of the ML pipeline.
In the meanwhile, we use the Mean Absolute Error as an intuitive evaluation metric.

We standardized the label to have it between [0-1], for sake of dimensionality.

![Real Wealth](images/real.png)

In the above image, For the state Araria, we can see the scaled label. 0 being poor and 1 rich.
There is a district that has a higher wealth than the rest.

### Explainable Machine learning pipeline

Due to the possible impact of this project on public policy, we advocate for an explainable ML approach <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>.
![Trained Decision Tree](images/tree_ohe.png)

For the modeling part a set of experiments to determine which machine learning estimators was performed.
The selected estimator for this part of the project was a decision tree, due to its key performance
 and given that the data that we are working with at this stage relative small.
This model also allows us to understand how are the ML decisions made.

## Results

After preprocessing the data the following results were obtained.
![Predicted Wealth](images/preds.png)
![Difference of Wealth](images/diff.png)

In the difference of wealth distribution, we can see where our model is achieving the best results and where it's failing.
This visualization can help to gain trust in the model since metrics do not always give users an understanding of a model's performance.

We can note in the heatmap that most of the errors are between [0.1,0.2]%. This percentual error in the predictions is low
 and provides preliminary evidence that a model should be able to perform with a high enough quality with a larger dataset.

### Conclusions

Predictive Model that is:

1. Open Source Data
2. Does not require cloud computing resources

Modeling remains explainable and accountable while preserving accuracy

1. Explainable and Interpretable machine learning
2. Accountable. It should be possible to trace the logical reasons why a decision was taken.
3. High Generalization: Simple models tend to have a higher generalization than complex models <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>

### Deliverables

The project had the following deliverables:

1. Project final [presentation](https://github.com/cmougan/WRI_WellBeing_Data_Layer/blob/master/Deliverables/Presentation.pdf)
2. A report with an extensive analysis of the methodology followed.
3. A separate module of the weighted Voronoi implementation in [gis-laguerre](https://github.com/dai-mo/gis-laguerre)
4. A corresponding article on weighted Voronoi for knowledge dissemination in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-preparation-for-geospatial-analysis-ml-with-laguerre-voronoi-in-python-71b9b418d8b6)

## Future Work

Future work steps:

1. Scaling Up: Due to the limitation of the computational resources we ended up only working for one district of India. 
 Its performance on state and national levels remains to be evaluated.
2. Integrate with NTL: One further data integration that should be helpful is the Night Light Data,
 this data theoretically should improve the accuracy in areas where OSM data is scarce.
3. Temporal Evaluation: As the goal of the project, is to prevent what will happen in the future with forests, 
there is the need to ensure that the model will generalize as time goes by.
