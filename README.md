## Project Scope
Conducting economic surveys requires huge resources; thus, modern means of acquiring this information using publicly available data and open source technologies create the possibilities of replacing current processes.
Satellite images can act as a proxy for existing data collection techniques such as surveys and census to predict the economic well-being of a region.

The aim of the project is to propose an alternative to Demographic Health Surveys using opoen source data such us Open Street Map, Sentinel and Night Light data.

The initial prototype created a model that had an accuracy of almost 70 percent. 
The aim is to create a model for India that can be adapted and scaled to other countries.
